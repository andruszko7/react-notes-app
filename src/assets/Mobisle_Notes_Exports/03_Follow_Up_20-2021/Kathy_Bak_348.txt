Hi Bobby. Wow! Thank you for your quick reply! I have a couple concerns though. #1.  Not sure if the wall is a load bearing wall. Is there a way for you to check that?. #2. Forecast for next week is rain and snow. I would hate to have a open wall in that weather. Im not in a huge hurry, and open to doing it later when the weathers better.
