Things have taken a bit longer to get all in order as I had hoped. In the interim, curious if possible to get a bathroom estimate and your thoughts on just getting a new tub and tile sooner than later? I ask because I fear we are going to get water damage with our tub as some parts are falling apart. 


Below was my attempt at measuring. But curious if possible to only do the tub and tile without having to do the floor or remove the vanity to do the work. If that is possible, I can plan to get parts estimated for that (I have the tub and faucet

 from Home Depot and would provide the title from CFM that I received from Brooke). I just don't know what other parts I need to cost out. The kitchen is still a goal but I am still costing out all options before we would be willing to move forward. Right now I am working for IKEA still on cabinets/countertops and what installation fee would be. 


Bathroom Measurements:

Floor length (Door to Far wall): 86.5in long

Vanity to Tub width: 3in

Tub: 15in high, 59in long, 30.5in wide

Current Shower tile: 48in tall and 59in long, 34in wide
