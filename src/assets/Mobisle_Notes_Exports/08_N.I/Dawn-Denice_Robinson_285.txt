Built in1979
I am the contact for my mom, Linda Schmitt. We met with Shawn Mitchell this morning and he recommends you for her painting needs. We want a bid for exterior painting of her duplex and one for interior painting of her side only. Linda is the owner of the property. Linda's grandson works for Sherwin-Williams and that means the paint will be provided for this project. As for the masking materials and other supplies, she will not provide those. Are you interested in looking at the property? If so, please write or call me and we will work out a time to meet.
