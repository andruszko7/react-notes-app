Homeowner Notes:
It is painted white 
I don't know if it scrapes off easily
I don't know if it has been tested for asbestos 
The house was built in 1965 
If possible I would like a quote with and without painting it
I would like it to be a smooth finish

I am hoping to have this done sometime between June 22 - 26th.
