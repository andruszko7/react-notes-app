Email Notes:
David Ward, Dawn Hughes. Looking to have downstairs floors replaced, except for the den. Stairway footing replaced, as well as upstairs hallway. Maybe some urine damage to underflooring in places. Will have to wait for carpet to be pulled to determine that. Some urine damage to drywall in some places. Will need to be sanded, Killz, and repainted. I should be home tomorrow, quite likely on Wednesday, and maybe on Friday. Dawn should be home.
