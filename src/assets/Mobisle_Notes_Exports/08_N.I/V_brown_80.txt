To Summarize re painting... All trim (new/existing on windows, doors, garage door), gutters, rake/fascia boards on house, front pergola, to be coated in Sherwin-Williams Semi gloss equivalent of MILLER "Black-burgundy # 8316N" ("brown" paint color). All that is currently "brown" or trim that currently has white primer, will be painted "brown". This is so that when the entire outside of the house (and downspouts) are repainted, the trim will have already been completed. 

Roger that, all trim goes black burgundy.
