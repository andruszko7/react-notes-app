Painting the interior walls of the house including the. Baseboards, replace if necessary ( repairing al the dry wall holes)


Walls only, no ceilings correct?

The feelings looked to be in good condition to me and I don't think that they need any paint.

Will you send me the color that you have in mind for the walls and I will order the paint from Sherwin-Williams and have it on site when we begin.


- replace two damaged bedroom doors


Hollow core 6 panel doors w/ old or new hardware on the doors?, correct? 


It may be a good idea to upgrade the door hardware 2 satin nickel handles and hinges what do you think Mike?


-paint all the kitchen cabinets


Stock white pro Classic semi gloss.


- make a stand for the stove so it’s even with all the cabinets


2 x 4 framing with a wide non textured smooth white piece of trim on the front to cover framing, correct?


- repair bathroom floors x 2 bathrooms, damage done by hose connected to toilet ( remove all added hoses to the toilet)


Labor Pricing & Materials $TBD after demo of carpet in master bathroom & guest bathroom flooring is demoed.  Discovery with findings/assessment & pics will be emailed to you for sign off. Subsheeting, toilet demo & installation, new baseboards installed in both bathrooms, installed 1 coat of pro Classic & caulking.


Option 1:

My advice is to upgrade the vanities in both bathrooms to nicer countertops that come w the vanity installed already so you can get a higher rental amount for the upgrades?  Install satin nickel door pull knobs in kitchen & on vanities. Please pick out 2 new vanities on home depot.com send the links over to me so I can order them after demo if you agree with me. 


Option 2: Paint existing vanities w pro Classic white & have the new renters deal with the eye sore & outdated vanities & sink hardware? 


- repair fence pickets

Demo existing fence on left side & back side, (if you're looking out from the inside to the back yard). Right side fence seems to be in good shape with exception of the part that's not attached presently attached to the side of the house by the back man door that leads into the garage. 


- check roof for any leaks caused by satellite 


Remove satellite and bolts, fill in holes with Henry's Roofing tar, correct?


Possibly replace kitchen sink with new overmount kitchen sink & hardware?
