Okay, great! The fridge panel is the main priority, so it sounds like for
the first appointment we could start with removing that, and also cutting
off a bit of paint for the later painting appointment. The option to get
the paint delivered works best for me. The bedroom wall issues are minor
and might be able to be cleaned, so the hallway would be the priority for
the painting.

I'm not too worried about the cabinet above the fridge, but if possible, it
would be great if you could cut the right side panel to cover up the empty
space above the fridge.
