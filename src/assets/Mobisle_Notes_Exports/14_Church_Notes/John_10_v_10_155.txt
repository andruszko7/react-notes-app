John 10 v 10
Zao love
Bios biology
Perisos extraordinary more than necessary

Matthew 11 v 28-30

Following Jesus will always cost you something 

Gather- its vital & important 
To be filled with the holy spirit
Frees us from our cultural narratives 
Joins us to Jesus's mission

Scatter-Anti isolation,
Frees us from the need to do life alone

Practice-Frees us from the need to be perfect & releases us into life w him

 eternal life starts now
Discipleship 
Silence & time w God
Generosity in secret 
Sacrificial love

Go places w God you never thought possible

If you could have God do anything for you today what would it be?

If you could do anything with God, what would it be?
