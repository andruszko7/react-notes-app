Lift head weary sinner

The river's just ahead

Down the path of forgiveness;

Salvation's waiting there

You built a mighty fortress

Ten thousand burdens high

Love is here to lift you up

Here to lift you high

If you're lost and wandering

Come stumbling in like a prodigal child

See the walls start crumbling

Let the gates of glory

Open wide

Verse 2

All who strayed and walked away

Unspeakable things you've done

Fix your eyes on the mountain

Let the past

Be dead and gone

Come all saints and sinners

You can't outrun God

Whatever you've done can't overcome

The power of the blood

Chorus 2

If you're lost and wandering

Come stumbling in like a prodigal child

See the walls start crumbling

Let the gates of glory

Open wide

If you're lost and wrecked again

Come stumbling in like a prodigal child

See the walls start crumbling

Let the gates of glory

Open wide

Scripture References:

Verse 1

I used to shake You like an 8-ball

I used to shoot You like a gun

I used to hold You like a hammer

Try to nail down everyone

I used to keep You in a steeple

Used to bind You in a Book

I used to take You like prescription

Without knowing what I took

Chorus

No, I've tried and I've tried to know

everything for sure

But I find I know less as I come to know You more

You're not who I thought You were

Praise the Lord

Verse 2

Your love's an ocean, not a river

A symphony, not just a song

I don't think everybody's right

I just think often get it wrong

I think that when we get to Heaven

We're gonna laugh when we can see

How hard we try to make it

And how easy it should be

Chorus

And so I just don't buy it anymore

No, I've tried and I've tried to know

everything for sure

But I find I know less as I come to know You more

You're not who I thought You were

Praise the Lord, oh my soul

Praise the Lord, oh my soul

Verse 3

Providence is endless

Mercy is a mystery

And fear is no good reason

To believe in anything

Chorus

So I just don't buy it anymore

No, I've tried and I've tried to know everything for sure

But I find I know less as I come to know You more

You're not who I thought You were

How He Loves

Scripture References:

Verse 1
He is jealous for me,
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.

I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
And how great Your affections are for me.

And, oh, how He loves us, oh,
Oh, how He loves us,
How He loves us all

He is jealous for me,
Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree,
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.

And how great Your affections are for me.

How He loves us all

Yeah, He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves.

And we are His portion and He is our prize,
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
If his grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.
And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
I don't have time to maintain these regrets,
When I think about the way...

That He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves.
