Faithfulness Psalm 101
August 18th 2019 church notes
Psalm 101- Faithfulness 
God asks me to be faithful to him in little faithful in a lot
$ is just a test
Stewardship faithful to him

Things that will derail your faithfulness 
Love of $
Making Compromises making the right choices & not the wrong choices 
Pride arrogance 
Success is a test of my allegiance to God let others praise you not your own mouth. Pride will make you act corruptly if you are full of yourself, haughty God will bring you down to  a humble position.
My good & faithfull servant...
Preach the Good news
God always prepares you for the next step in life
Stay faithful to your family, Isaiah mom sarah Dad
