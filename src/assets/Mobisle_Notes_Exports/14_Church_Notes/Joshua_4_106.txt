Joshua 4
Joshua 4
Remember from my past, it changes the way I think & influences & affects me now

Anthropomorphism
God puts your sin behind his shoulder blade.

Sins is forgiven & forgotten by God

Can a Christian forget God?
Faith is remembering God
Bring God back into my reality
not creatures of the moment
God gave us an eternal soul

Remembering encourages us to not despair about our weaknesses

Live by faith not by sight
Eternal faith perspective vs living in the moment & what you see in front of you
Phillipians 4 13

12 rocks were underwater then set up in memorial to God's work of stopping the waters of the Jordan so Israel could cross over into the promised land of Canaan 
Remembering causes us to thank God & praise him
Now I have a hope & a future compared to the past of who I was?

How am I different from a year or five Yeats ago? 

Remembering enables us to speak of God to people.

A testimony & a witness is remembering.

Write down 5-10 things of what God has done in my life... that's your testimony. Count your blessings of what God has done for me.

Make a blessings book
