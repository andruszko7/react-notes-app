Soul 1
Psalm 23
Simple awareness of knowing God
I dont need anything else but you!
Be honest about the profound brokenness of my soul.
Dont isolate yourself, thats the worst thing you can do.

You dont need protective shell, break it open, run to Jesus.
Open your heart to God in Gratitude & Praise.

Matthew 11 28-30


Colossians 3 V 1-17
Identify Burden & release your burdens
Surrender give it all & give it away to Jesus.
Roots of God
Dwelling on the things of God

Deal with short term sacrifice for long term gain

"Wherever you go, there you are"
