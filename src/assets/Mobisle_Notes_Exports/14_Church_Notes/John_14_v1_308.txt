John 14 v1
Faith as commodity 
Benefits financially 
Prosperity gospel or ideology ruins people 
Trying to manipulate God to get what we want?

Faith as Optimism 
Live your truth 
Hallmark movies cheesy ideas
You can do it

Faith as Exclusion 
Biased perspectives 
We only have the truth

Faith is rational 
Based on Reality
Evidence Jesus is Lord
Faith anchors us

Faith is...
Intimacy 
Relational
Personal

There's a big difference between knowing of God and knowing him intimately 

Faith is 
John Wesley said
Scriptural based 
Tradition
Reason 
Experience-
Jesus in day to day trenches of life Sun- Mon. He's there through it all

Faith changes how we live
Jesus calls us to radical surrender 
Hebrews 11 V1

Marriage is
Your faith is a covenant 
Contractual
Its an act of faith 
If you confess w your mouth
& believe in your heart 

Power in speaking life, Gods words outloud 
Words changes how you do life

Faith is the pathway to Peace 
Heart is restless water is agitated & troubled & fearful. 
God will calm that storm inside of you
When we are faith less Jesus is Faithful  Full of faith 
Jesus promises us a Peace that transcends All Understanding, surpasses it, The Lord will give you Rest & Peace
Be still & know that I Am God...
Let not your heart be troubled 
Phillipines ch 4v 6-7


Our beliefs & faith shapes our words
