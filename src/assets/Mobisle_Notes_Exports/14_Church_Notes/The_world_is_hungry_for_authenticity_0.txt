Ezekiel 47
Isaiah 6 

What is God asking me To do?
Who does God want me to speak to? 

Giving has to do with ownership
God owns all of it 
Giving has to do with stewardship
Enjoy and employ looking after what God has entrusted to me 
We have to be completely trustworthy
If you are faithful w little God will bless you with more, if Money is your God he will not entrust you with more. 
We are conduits of God's generosity in which God's love flows through us so we can bless others.  
Matthew 6 v 18 -21
Where you put your money is where your heart will follow because you are invested.  
Giving is a heart issue, not, a financial one.
It's a lordship issue, 
Lay up treasure in heaven not in earth
1 Timothy 6 v 7
Revelation I'm coming quickly and my reward is with me. 

As you trust him, he is Lord of all not your pocketbook.

3 marks of a generous believer
1 Give generously not sparingly,  seeds-$ crops- reaping generosity
Sacrificial giving- giving until it hurts, keep your motives pure
Proverbs 11-24 
2 give cheerfully & joyfully,  not reluctantly or grudgingly God sees your heart weighs your motives
3 Give in faith,  realizing you can't out give God
The 1st check you write is your tithe, honor God with the 1st fruits of your wealth.  Take a step of faith,  he is your provider,  not you. 

Giving is the true barometer of where you are at with your relationship with God
You can live close fisted and not receive or you can live open handed and receive more

Zechariah 4 v 6

"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books."

—Revelation 20:12 NIV1984
 

On the basis of the Bible, we may safely conclude that not all existence in hell is equal. First, the unified testimony of Scripture is that God is perfectly just and will reward and punish each person in accordance with what he or she has done (Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12; Jeremiah 17:10; Ezekiel 18:20, 30; Romans 2:5–16; 1 Corinthians 3:8, 11–15; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Colossians 3:23–25; 1 Peter 1:17; Revelation 20:12).

Proverbs 27:17 
The Message (MSG)

Your Face Mirrors Your Heart

17 You use steel to sharpen steel,
    and one friend sharpens another.

We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed to have in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better. (Pr 27:18)


A good friend is not someone who necessarily agrees with everything you do and say--it's somebody who lovingly challenges you to be a better person. We grow in maturity when we can test our thoughts and ideas against another person, and when we're open to correction when we're wrong.
