Children
Mark 9 33-37
Children are a gift from God to your parents
Raising a child is like a building a house
Children are a gift and treasure to be valued
Kids are to be molded & unfolded
Dont compare isaiah to others let him be himself  accept him the way he is & how God fearfully made him & wired him
Be authentic
Be a father like your Father in heaven
TT Isaiah about what God is doing in my life visualize it
Pray for Isaiah?
The greatest thing you will ever do is raising Isaiah & being his Dad
Isaiahs innocence should be protected
