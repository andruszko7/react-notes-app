John 1 43v51
Wrestling out the Jacob in me

Does my internal heart & thought life match up w my external life of words & actions?
Jesus is found in all of the old testament 
Jesus has total knowledge of us
Jesus has a personal relationship with us  & tailors our circumstances to have a more intimate relationship with him 

Jesus opens heaven to us.
Walk in the light & God is with us always. Heaven is open to us cuz the holy spirit is in us. Holy spirit temple carriers. Manifest presence of God. 1
