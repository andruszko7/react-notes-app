My story of God filling the void in my life only God can do this. The word of God spoke creation into your life 
You are a new creation in God all the former things have passed away 
God brings Light to the darkness ephesians 5 v 8
You have a new identity 
The light shines in the darkness & the darkness will not overcome it nor does it comprehend it
Whatever darkness you're in will not have the final word
