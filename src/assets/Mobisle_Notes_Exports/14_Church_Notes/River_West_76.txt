Holiness is moving towards God
Conformed to his likeness 
The pursuit of him changes you
Romans 12 v 1 & 2
Metamorphosis
2 Corinthians 3 v 18

1)Do this everyday for the rest of your life.
Set before God your physical body and present it him & say this is your body. I submit it to him.  Pray into this truth. 
This is my living  sacrafice put on his altar. Everything I do is for your glory.
I want to honor you w my body.

2) Renewal of your mind.  The mind of Christ. I want to change. In humility submit your mind to him. 
Come w a desire to be renewed.

When I go to church do I come w a humble heart?  Do I believe God has a word for me?  Am I going to go be a doer of the word? Not sit on sidelines don't stall out and be complacent?
