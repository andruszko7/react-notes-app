Parables 4
See the humanity in people as God weaves grace, mercy & redemption into their story too

Don't just bandage wounds of victims beneath the wheels of injustice
drive a spoke into the wheel itself
deitrch Bonhoeffer 
Radical love deserves investment

Jesus is what radical love looks like
He is the epitome of radical Love
