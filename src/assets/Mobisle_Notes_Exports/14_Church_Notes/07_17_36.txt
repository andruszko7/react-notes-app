David

We live in this moment between the ascension & the kingdom of heaven comes crashing down on earth.
1)It's time to expand our perspective of God
Hyper focus on the little things not the larger picture of what God is doing in the invisible realm & the tangible reality

2) God is working on something much larger than our own personal kingdom

Redemption hope healing love & trust

Whose kingdom are you currently building
