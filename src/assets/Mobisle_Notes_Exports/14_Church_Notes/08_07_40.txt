2 Samuel 11
3 Enemies 
The World 
The Flesh
The Devourer

James 1 v 14-15
Romans 13v15
7 days for mourning for Uriah the Hittite 

David's  actions  displeased God
Psalm 51 & 32 3-4
Selah- pause & consider 
God doesn't  allow his children to sin successfully 
The anger of man doesn't 

Cure for guilt
come clean, repent, confess-agree with God, foresake 

What a man sows that is what he will reap.
There are always consequences of sin.
