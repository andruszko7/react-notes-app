John 12
John  12 v12-36@
Psalm 118 1-5 15-16 19-23 25-29
This psalm was sung n repeated by the Israelites thats why they knew what to do
Zachariah 9 v8-10
Hosanna-Save Us Now
Singing at the top of their lungs
They praised him as king 1 moment then 1 week later they were saying crucifiy him.
Jesus is a warrior King but he was unlike any other king or politician in all of history.
The servant King served all people,  not for political influence admiration ego pride or power. He came to save all people.
Its time for his glorification 
Life comes from Death
Death burial Resurrection =  Eternal Life for all. Jesus' death created a new family and it established the new covenant with mankind. His kids 
Billions of people are invited from the seed that died for us.
We need to live & die w him. Self love leads to self destruction put yourself first you lose.

You give up your life to God he gives you eternal life & you win cuz God is able to take that seed & regraft it into himself and make it grow & endure forever 

Jesus is not a victim he is a Hero
The real triumphal entry was when he stepped out of the tomb Resurrected 
The enemy is a defeated foe
Which will you follow the Darkness or the Light?

Follow me into death Jesus says
Victory is in dying to self lay down your life to receive Jesus in his entirety 
Self displacement place Jesus at the epicenter of all that you do and are & will be.
Live for yourself & ally yourself with the enemy or die to self & live for Jesus.


What are you expecting from Jesus as a follower?

How has God satisfied that in your life?
