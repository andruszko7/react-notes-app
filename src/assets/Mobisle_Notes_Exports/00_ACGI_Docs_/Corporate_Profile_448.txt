Company Background-
I was introduced to the construction industry at the age of 12 by my father, Bob Andruszko. We painted some vertical T111 at a neighbor's house together and after back rolling for 7 hrs I told my dad, that was the hardest work I had ever done. He laughed and never forgot that and asked me if I still wanted to be a painter? Of course I did, viola! 21 years later, Andruszko Painting was established. 

During college, at PSU, I acquired 4 years of experience working for various unions, labor companies & contractors in Portland. I started my company with my tax returns in 2009; over the last 11 years, I have learned a great deal about construction, working hard and running a business. I'm on site for every project that we are awarded. We offer free estimates, in-house financing, interior design services, turn key solutions from our builder and subcontractor teams.
