Tell us about your project.
Hello, I am wondering if you have availability to help us with some projects in our home. 

These are the main pressing projects listed below. 

1) Currently do not have door on closet. Would like Bi-fold Closet Doors (and adding molding around closet opening)

2) Bathroom "shelf" finishing (we would like a surface made to cover this area behind the toilet)

3) Front Step Filler to save railing post

We may have more but wanted to start with this list. Thank you.
