We are looking for someone who can repair/rebuild our master bath tiled shower bench. It was constructed in 2014 and recently 3 tiles became discolored. Our contractor responsible is not available. I went to replace the tiles myself to find rusted screws behind causing the discoloration. My concern is now that we may have to address a plumbing issue and have the bench re-built. I do have plenty spare tile to cover the project.
