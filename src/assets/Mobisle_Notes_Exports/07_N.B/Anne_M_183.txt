Do you have paint?

When do you need service?
As soon as possible

Anything else we should know?
Looking for bids.

I need removal of popcorn ceiling (non-asbestos), retexturing of ceiling (nothing fancy, maybe smooth or orange peel), and painting of ceiling. If we can come up with a price that works for us both, possibly painting the walls as well. No drywall repair needed, only some screw holes needing patched.
Ceilings are normal height, maybe 7-8', area needed is approximately 1400 sqf, though we can talk about patching up the seam in the 200 sqf media room also, plus painting ceiling and walls in there. 
My preference is covering furniture and moving things out from the walls, rather than moving everything out of the rooms, as there's no way I can accomplish that. Preferably to be done by mid-July at the latest.
Licensed, bonded, and insured only, please. References and photos of prior work strongly preferred.
