Nathan Woosley

Hi Bobby, this is Nathan Woolsey again.  I would like an exterior house painting quote, please.  It's a 2 story home at 1750 sq. ft.  Simple neutral paint scheme is fine, looking to sell next year.  I have the damage repair construction going on now but in a few weeks they'll be done and i'd like it painted before the rain season comes.  20784 SW Gracie St., Beaverton, OR 97006

Thank you, Nathan Woolsey
