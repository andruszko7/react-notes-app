We are replacing a 1990s built in kitchen desk (the kind no one ever used) with above shelving with a pantry (drawers on bottom, shelving on top)  We have had very tough luck with companies even calling us back so have gone to Yelp.  The very rough dimensions of the space are- height (96, 8 foot ceilings), width 59 and depth 25.5 (counter depth)
