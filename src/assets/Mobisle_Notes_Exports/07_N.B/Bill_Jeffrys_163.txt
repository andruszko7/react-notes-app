I’d like to retexture and paint one hallway, one small bedroom, the master bedroom, and one walk-in closet. 

The walk in closet needs the popcorn ceiling scraped off

Don't know if the popcorn in closet is asbestos free. 

1977

Yes it was painted.

I'm looking to get it done within two weeks.
Orange peel is good.
I'll scrape the closet if it will save me a bunch.
