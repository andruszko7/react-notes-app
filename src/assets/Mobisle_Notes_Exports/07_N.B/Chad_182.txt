Hello,  we are a business in need of some miscellaneous construction assistance. We have an office in our basement in which we need several things completed 

1) Carpet torn out AND replaced (Commercial grade carpet currently is installed, on cement)
2) Tear down a wall (that wall has a door in it)
3) Repair drywall, patch, etc. for surrounding walls that were affected by teardown of wall in #2 above
4) Put in a door into an existing wall. Door frame is already in place, re-use door from #2 above? or install new door.
