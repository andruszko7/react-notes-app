Nick & Christina

Hello, we recently bought a house where the interior walls have a very heavy and irregular orange peel type texture. We would like to re-texture the interior walls to be more subtle and have everything repainted. It is a single level 1840 sq ft home with no vaulted ceilings. Roughly how many days would this take, what would be the cost, and what is the lead time is for getting this type of job scheduled? Thanks, Christina Morgan

Hi Bobby, I tried emailing you on Friday at Bobby@acgihomes.com but I'm not sure if it went through. My husband will be home Thursday and Friday if you have time to go by later this week. His name is Nick Morgan and his phone number is (541) 324-6670. The address is 1248 NW Fall Ave, Beaverton, OR 97006.

We do not have paint colors decided for all rooms but should have that decided soon.

Thanks,
Christina
