I misspoke about the trim. We’re not doing it ourselves...we’re holding off on that project. But meeting in August

Tell us about your project
I would like a quote to install interior trim on a 1400 sq ft home. I also need a quote for painting the exterior of the home on cement fiber siding. 


I haven’t selected paint samples yet. I just know I want a gray color with white trim. I’m a little nervous in picking a paint sample. We painted the inside, like it at first, but turned out to have more blue in it than we would have liked. At least it looks that way. The dried paint on the paint lid on the other hand is the color I wanted. Does the color change at all with different types of siding? Currently we have vinyl siding and are looking to change it to cement fiber. As far as the trim goes, my fiancé decided he will be installing it himself. Sent from my iPhone11:17 PM

Sorry, I forgot to finish replying to the rest of the message. Address is 9913 NE 121st Ct, Vancouver 98682. I would like both my fiancé and I to be there when you come take measurements and determine the bid amount, but his schedule is a little off. The next weekend we both have open is first weekend in August. Does that work for you?
