I am free any time this week, though I would prefer to meet up mid-day if possible.


Thank you for your information & quick response.  We just got our contact form up on our site so that's why there was a delay in our response time.  I have a few projects going on this week so I will promptly schedule with you next week if thats ok with you? What time midday works for you if something opens up Thursday?
