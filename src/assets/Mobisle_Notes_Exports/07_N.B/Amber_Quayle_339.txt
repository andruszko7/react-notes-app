Message : Hello! I am looking to have my kitchen/laundry/bathroom flooring redone. There is approximately 121SF between the three rooms. I have selected luxury vinyl plank to be installed. I had a toilet leak, so I believe the subfloor will need to be repaired/replaced. I'm located in Beaverton. Thanks!
