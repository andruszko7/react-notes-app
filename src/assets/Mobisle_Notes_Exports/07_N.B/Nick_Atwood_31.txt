Replace 2 broken windows on side of house.
Repair dripping shower faucet spout.

Replace siding strip on roof chimney

Better roof ventilation (maybe soffit vents/attic fan?)

Also the sellers are looking into the stain on the Sheetrock ceiling. I hope it's not a leak, maybe mud that didn't dry when painted, or something I researched called ghosting when condensation builds up in the joists.

Attach flue pipe (maybe clean out bird jamming opening/closing mechanisms)

Labor $1500-2200 pending further inspection
