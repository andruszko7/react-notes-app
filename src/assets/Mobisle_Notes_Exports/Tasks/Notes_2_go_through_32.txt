At a holiday party last year, my cousin, who owns a flooring business, was explaining to me a few pains that he has in running his business. They were as follows:

He spends too much time running back and forth to potential client's homes to update bidsWhen he leaves a bid with a client, he doesn't know when they review it and when to follow upPotential clients are increasingly asking him to "Send the bid to their email", but he can't find a simple way to create bids, send them, and track the ones that are sentHis clients are increasingly asking him to pay with a debit or credit card, which requires him to run to various job sites to collect payments via Square. He'd like clients to pay him online.When you have several projects at once with milestone payments, it's difficult to keep track of who owes what. He'd like an easier way to do this.Invoicing applications just aren't designed to suit contractor's needs
