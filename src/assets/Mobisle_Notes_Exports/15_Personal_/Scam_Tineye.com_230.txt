Scam Tineye.com

I feel for all of you who were scammed by these heartless people. I know now that I will not take any mans word for it on who he is again without always thinking in the back of my mind .. is this another scammer ??... This is cruel and heartless to do to anyone . My advice to you all is that you do as I do ... I will copy and paste a profile of a person on an online dating site that makes contact with me to see if the profile is copied ( but the again , more people do it often) secondly, I take their picture and do a reverse search look up on Tineye.com a free site and see what comes up, even if nothing comes up I will still take it one step further and copy the picture and do an image search on Bing,com ( images) as well as Google.com ( images) , it is so very sad that one has to resort to this , because I do feel that there are real men out there looking to find true love , as we all are, but have learned the hard way, as most of you have as well, that you cannot ever be too careful . Thanks also to this site I am more aware what to look for and will continue to use caution and hopefully the man of my dreams will come into my life and this is my hope for all of you as well ...
