HOW TO MAKE LEMON DROP COOKIES

Mix up the cookie dough. Use a small cookie scoop to place dough on lined baking sheets. Bake until the edges are golden.

Whisk together the lemon glaze in a mixing bowl.

Dip the tops of your cooled cookies in the glaze and allow the cookies to sit so the glaze can set up.

TIPS FOR MAKING LEMON DROP COOKIES

Make sure your baking powder is not expired. This will cause the cookies to lose their fluffy texture inside and they could come out hard all around.

These “cookies” are basically like mini scones. The flavor of the biscuit/cookie part is a very subtle lemon with a hint of vanilla – it’s not big on flavor. The big lemony punch comes from the glaze, so don’t skip icing them!!

Using a small cookie scoop, you should get 2 dozen plus cookies in a batch. This can vary depending on the size of your scoops.

One of my favorite things about these cookies is the texture. The outsides are firm, but the inside of the cookie is light and almost cakey. I’ve been known to eat a handful of them in one sitting. They’re a fantastic little bite any time of year!
