Narrator:

Although it can feel overwhelming to have so many goals, thinking carefully about your priorities can help you decide what to fund first. Here are some strategies to consider: if your main goal is to become debt free, you can start by making extra payments on your balances.

Narrator:

Perhaps you want to multitask or work toward all goals at once. In that case, you could put a small amount of money toward each one every month.

Narrator:

Maybe you want to pursue the goal that'll give you a potentially higher payoff. For example, if you expect to earn higher interest rates on your investments, you can put your money toward investing. If you're being charged high interest rates on your debts, it might make more sense to make extra debt payments instead.

A drawing illustrates a scale measuring two different percent signs.

Narrator:

Finally, if your employer offers a retirement match, you may want to consider making at least the minimum contribution to your plan so that you get the full match.

Narrator:

No matter what strategy you choose, always make at least the minimum payments on all of your debts. This way you'll continue to protect your credit health while you work toward your goals.
