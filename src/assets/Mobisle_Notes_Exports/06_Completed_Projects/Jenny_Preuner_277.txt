Thanks for taking the call today.   Please see the attachments, the last attachment has a more detailed list of the itemized report that I will need you to review.  The Relo company is sending a mold/environmentalist out tomorrow Tues 6/25/19.  And I will hire a pest control specialist to further investigate the pests in the crawl space. Just spoke with my husband Dustin and the relo company is not sending a contractor to look at the chimney, not sure if you do that or not, please let me know if you can take a look at it as well. Like I said, time is of the essence, we are moving out of the house July 2.  Our realtor can provide access to the home if necessary.  I will be home all week until then.  I understand a few of these items can just be signed off, a few others will need to be assessed and need work. Please let me know your rate and availability. & Let me know if you have any further questions. Looking forward to hearing from you and getting this completed correctly.
