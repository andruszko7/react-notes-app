This is a grey/yellow home with white trim.

Note that the house number is not visible from the street. However, it is the third home on the left going east off of Cedar Hills Blvd.


This is a duplex, and a common wall is shared with another owner on the north side. The other home has the same color palette, and is also interested in having the east and west side of both our homes painted, but she does not want the front (north) of her house painted.

 I want the south, east and west sides painted. We can discuss more when we meet. 

3 colors on Wayne's side
2 Colors on Owner 2 side



I am available next week most mornings and afternoons. Let me know your availability and we can go from there.
