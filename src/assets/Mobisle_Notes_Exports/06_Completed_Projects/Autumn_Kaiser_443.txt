Auti Notes:
Doorway 1 has lower corner dry rot, doorway 2 had doorframe installed backwards and has been collecting water.

The floor inside of doorway 2 has been damaged due to the poor doorway install. About 2x3 feet of damaged subfloor and down into the wood below it, not sure how far that goes.
