Hello ACGI,

We are looking for quotes to re-paint, re-caulk and repair any damaged trim for the exterior of our home. We believe it has the original paint from 2008 and we are starting to see some cracks in the caulk and some flakes in the paint. Our HOA requires certain paints; we would need the following:


Body - SW 6121 Whole Wheat

Trim - SW 6119 Antique White

Board and Batten to match trim


We are in the Arbor Pointe subdivision:


16387 SW Dekalb St, Tigard, OR 97224


Could you provide a quote for Paint/Caulk/Trim Repair? When might you be able to start?
