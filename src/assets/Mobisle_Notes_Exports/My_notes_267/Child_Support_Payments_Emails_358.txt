Child Support Payments Emails
Hey Rachael,

So essentially you were saying that the original balance that is due to the state was $10,460. And Marissa got a total is in July of $1640.20? And if I make another payment in July she'll only get $461 out of whatever or overage I pay & the rest is arrears owed to the state for tanf & food stamps for what time period? 2 years? Please advise?

Bobbly,
 
I am responding just to you but you are more than welcome to forward my email to Mariza or have her reach out directly to the current case manager Juliana Picon ( juliana.m.picon@doj.state.or.us 503-640-7040.
Your monthly court ordered amount is $461. We ask that you pay $553.20 each month so that the extra $92.20 go to any arrears that are owed on the case—Arrears owed to mom are paid off first then the state.
Between  June 1st- June 30th we received 3 payments:
 $553 – 6/1
 $1200- 6/5
 $1800- 6/29
Mariza received $553 and then $1087.20.
This is because $461 is owed to her each month and she had a small portion of arrears owed to her but the rest of the $8,554.50 balance is owed to the state. So the remaining $1912.80 went to the state of Oregon to pay down your balance. 
Any payment you send and is received between July 1st and July 31st will be processed as follows: $461 to Mariza and any amount over that goes to pay your balance down and as of today all arrears are owed to the state.
 


These are the numbers I’m seeing
Total balance beginning June 2020: 11,185.50

10,006.30 for State Arrears

1,179.20 Arrears due to Mariza

461 monthly support for June

Yes, Mariza received $1640.20 for June and the rest of the balance went towards state arrears.
Any payment made in July—461 to Mariza and the rest to your state balance.
Food stamps is not included but TANF was open between 2011 to 2013 and then it appears on/off in 2014-2015.  
 
Let me know if you need anything else!
