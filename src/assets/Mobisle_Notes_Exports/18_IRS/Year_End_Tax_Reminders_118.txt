Year End Tax Reminders
If you are a landlord or have a small business, you may be required to mail 1099-MISC forms. Anyone to whom you pay more than $600 in cash or check during the tax year could require the necessary form.  For example:

·  Attorneys

·  Landlords (if you pay rent)

·  Vendors

·  Contractors

·  Maintenance/Labor/Cleaning

There are some tricky exceptions - you don't have to send 1099 forms to corporations for example - so please contact us if you think this may apply to you.  

 

If you know that you will need to send 1099 forms and would like us to prepare them for you, please return the following attached document(s) no later than Monday January 15th.  If you only need a few and want to prepare them yourself, we will sell you a complete “set” for $4 per 1099 form.  If you would like us to prepare them for you, there will be a $40 set-up fee plus $5/1099.  You can save time by collecting W-9 forms (also attached) from each person to whom you paid at least $600 to during the tax year. 

 

Please remember that email is not a secure method for transmitting any document that contains a social security number.  Please upload these forms to your client portal or fax them to us at 503-620-9065.  If you need more information regarding client portals please go to our website at http://www.nelsontax.com/portalaccess.html or call us with questions.
