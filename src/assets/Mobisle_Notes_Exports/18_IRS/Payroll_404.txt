Payroll

I have left you a few messages but wanted to be sure you know that we have your Payroll notices here in our office to pick up. You will need to call the phone number on the notices to call in a $0 wages report for all of the months in questions.  The deadline is past due and they may charge interest and penalties if this is not taken care of soon.  Please pick them up at your earliest convenience so that you can get them taken care of.  Please let me know that you have received my messages.
