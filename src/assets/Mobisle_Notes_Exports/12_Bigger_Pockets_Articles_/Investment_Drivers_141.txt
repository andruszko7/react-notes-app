Investment Drivers
In real estate, the key items that make the difference are often things like purchase price, location, your business partners/vendors, and the economics of the local area. Get these things right and often the rest will follow to create a successful investment.

What Are Your Main Investment Drivers?

I’ve shared this often: My firm believes that the location plus the choice of a professional property manager drive about two-thirds of the success of our multifamily real estate acquisitions.



The locations we are seeking have:

Positive net population migration

Low unemployment

A diverse and growing economy

Affordable rents compared with home prices

Low crime, average schools, and average incomes over 3 times our projected rents

The property management firm we’re seeking:

Doesn’t own competing properties

Has a regional or national presence with upward mobility for employees

Uses top tier property management software

Has strict policies and accountability they enforce at all multifamily assets

Integrates well with our Apartment Life (or similar) programs to care for our tenants
