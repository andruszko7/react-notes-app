Your demo is your key to making a great first impression to the record label and eventually, your ticket on how to get signed to a record label. Therefore, it is important that you make your demo professional and appealing as well. Making a good demo may be an important requirement on how to get signed to a record label, but it does not assure you of any recording contract. Of course, record labels are considering many factors: your kind of music, your appeal and charisma, your versatility and most importantly, the marketability of your music,  although you can always get a chance to prove it to them if you impress them with your demo.

Here are some tips on how to make your demo stand out and send them to record labels.

The list is at the bottom, but DON'T SKIP OVER READING THE TIPS BEFORE YOU SUBMIT.
1

Making your demo does not have to be expensive. Although you have to make sure it is done professionally.

Get rid of as much as possible of poor recording that can ruin the shine of its composition. If you can't set up a good home recording studio, go to some studio that may not cost too much.

Rarely (And I do mean rarely), some record companies will "see through the bad quality" of a song to give someone with extraordinary talent a chance, but 99% of the time the people with talent believe in themselves and are putting forward the investment to make their music sound great.

Choose demo songs that capture the attention of your audience from the start. Your record needs to be AMAZING! The music industry is one of the most saturated out there. Make sure your show does not bore your listener. Choose something that you think is going to be a great piece to sell on the market.

One of the most annoying things an artist can do is flood a labels inbox with 15 emails of individual music submission links. Choose a couple of demo songs (at most) and don't overwhelm the record label with all of your collections since childhood. Carefully select a few tracks you think are attention-grabbers. If they ask for more, send more.

Know your music. It is vital that you know where your key audience is listening. A wise thing you can do before going to all record labels is to have a list of tags. Check out who is most likely to get interested in your type of music. You save yourself and the music supervisors time by submitting in your niche.

Before sending your demo to the label, make sure you know their submission guidelines. I can't tell you how many songs I instantly delete because an artist didn't follow the directions clearly stated on the submission page. Check the acceptable format or if there is a specific person you need to contact. Other labels can not accept demos directly from new artists, which means you need a music manager, so you may want to know the guidelines before going to the label.

By submitting your demo to the label, make sure you give them your email or phone number. Put your website and one or two social media channels at the bottom of the email as your signature.

Sending your demo can be frustrating at times, especially if your inbox is dryer than the Sahara! That's why it's important to reach out to smaller indie record labels as well. Some famous artists have been rejected the first time they send in their demos, so always be pleasant and well mannered. There's NO need to get all pissy after someone doesn't feature your music. Maybe you can get a second chance, but there are tons of blogs and record labels looking for artists.

There are countless bands competing for limited attention of record labels. Bands and artists have been known to do all sorts of crazy things to get noticed. The most absurd was satirized in films like Airheads that featured a band to take over a radio station by force to gain the attention of a label. However, the band may draw the attention of a label using simple and effective measures.

BECOME FRIENDS WITH MUSIC EXECUTIVES AND A&R'S LOOKING FOR TALENT

If you live in an industry friendly city such as Nashville, Los Angeles, New York or London, it's a little bit easier to go the industry route with your music.  Your network is your net worth. Even if you're trying to stay independent (which I recommend). You need to have a strong group of like minded people available to you achieve your goals, AND help other achieve their goals. Don't just think about what's in it for you. A good business relationship is mutually beneficial. That's how to go from just another artist submitting music to being in the network!
FINDING A GOOD MUSIC PROMOTER

After labels sign new bands, independent promoters are often the first to reserve them in specific cities. You can cultivate a relationship with a label by booking shows for one of their bands. New artists are essential to this because more established artists already have this process in place. A good music promoter (in this sense) is designed to have connections to venues. Some promotion service just focus online, but we're not talking about those right now.

Ultimately, there are many ways to build relationships with record executives who use these types of strategies outside the box. Try these tips for getting labels to notice your band.

How can you determine if a record label is looking for new talent? Very often, it will be right on the website of the company. Look for "Contact", "FAQ" or "Shipping" on the website of the record company. This is where you will find information about how to contact the record company and often how to send your demo CD.

Here, it is necessary to pay attention to the language used to describe page presentations. Some pages are enthusiastic in applying materials and say they are actively seeking new talents or artists. Others will be more timid, saying they are "always accepting submissions" and sign new talent regularly. And some companies simply say that "they are not accepting submissions at this time" and they are not looking for any new talent. No matter how great the label, you don't want your song ending up in the trash folder, so be wise about the submission.

CONCLUSION

Often times I'll hear artist complain that you need an insider to be heard at a major record label. While that's sometimes true, NEVER underestimate the power of sending an intriguing email. Most artists emails don't get featured because they've never studied marketing or psychology. Yes, that's right. I said marketing and psychology. GO READ A BOOK about it. You'll then understand how much goes into someone reading your email and the difference between you getting a response or not.

If you make great music you'll be featured… WRONG! How are supposed to be featured if you don't know how to get the right people's attention in the first place? Better yet, you need to know how to properly communicate with your listeners and build YOUR OWN music fan base. I'm seldom impressed by artists who attempt to name drop people they've attempted to work with without having any accomplishments of their own.

"I was in the studio with a guy who did production for Wiz Khalifa the other day." Ok… And then what? Are you full-time with your music? Do you have any substantive email list that you own? Is there any quantitative data that you can share that shows you'll be increasing your revenue in the next 12 months? Are your monthly listeners on any streaming site increasing? These are the questions smart artists should care about.

With a little research, you can find a great record label accepting demos in no time. With a working knowledge of how to contact the record labels, you will learn how to make a show with a record label, and once you know what labels are looking for talent, you'll be on your way to know how to achieve the signing of a major label record (if that's your goal).
