Convys Motivations feeling information to viewers and other characters has to be subtle

quirks, inconsistencies &
Idiosyncrasies use as a talking point & create dialogue around 


1 option 
Write story w no dialogue or write it last
after I find where the story is going.
Action has to be spread out over story
