Loan Types 
Can't put down a full 20%? Not a problem.

For years, lenders recommended that borrowers save 20% of the cost of their home for a down payment. That can be a lot of money. Take a look at these home loans that don’t require that much down.

FHA
These loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration require 3.5% down.

HOMEPOSSIBLE® + HOMEREADY®
Both these conventional mortgage programs, from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, respectively, only require a 3% down payment.

VA + USDA LOANS
If you’re a veteran or move to a rural area, you don’t need a down payment. Use your savings for other things you’ll need, like furniture or a maintenance budget.

GOOD NEIGHBOR NEXT DOOR
If you’re a teacher, law enforcement officer, firefighter or emergency medical technician, this down payment assistance program lets you buy a home with as little as $100 down as long as you. The biggest requirement is that you buy your home in a community designated as a revitalization area.

HUD DOLLAR HOMES
This program, offered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), helps low- to moderate-income families buy HUD-owned homes for $1 each, plus any closing costs. The homes for sale are foreclosed homes purchased by the FHA and made available when the government is unable to sell them for six months.

YOUR CITY OR STATE
Many state and local governments offer down payment assistance grants, loans and programs for qualified borrowers. Check with your city or state’s housing authority, or local nonprofits, to see what benefits are available.
